<!-- Create a detailed README for a DevOps template repository that includes sections on purpose, components, setup instructions, and usage examples -->

## Purpose
This repository serves as a template for setting up and managing DevOps pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), and automation scripts. It is designed to help teams quickly bootstrap their DevOps practices with reusable components and best practices.

## Components
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Templates for provisioning cloud resources using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Pre-configured pipelines for common CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Azure DevOps.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Scripts and configurations for setting up monitoring and logging solutions.
- **Automation Scripts:** Scripts for automating repetitive tasks like deployments, backups, and scaling.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/devops-template.git
   cd devops-template
   ```
2. Review and customize the configuration files in the `config/` directory.
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Example for Node.js-based tools
   npm install
   ```
4. Initialize and apply the infrastructure templates:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
5. Set up CI/CD pipelines by integrating with your preferred tool.

## Usage Examples
- **Deploying Infrastructure:**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
- **Running CI/CD Pipelines:**
   Push your changes to the repository, and the pipelines will automatically trigger.
- **Monitoring Logs:**
   Access the monitoring dashboard at `http://your-monitoring-url`.
